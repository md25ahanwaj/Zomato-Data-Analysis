## Project Description
The problem statement provided by Zomato was to analyze existing restaurant data to identify potential opportunities for opening new restaurants. The tasks involved:

- Cleaning the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Analyzing the cleaned data using pivot tables.
- Creating a dashboard to visualize the insights.
- Formulating strategies and suggestions for new restaurant locations.
## Data Cleaning
The raw data provided had several inconsistencies and missing values that needed to be addressed. The following steps were taken:

- **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate entries were identified and removed to prevent skewed analysis.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values were either filled with appropriate measures (mean, median, mode) or excluded based on the context.
- **Standardizing Data Formats:** Ensured uniformity in data representation, such as date formats, numerical values, and categorical data.
## Data Analysis
The cleaned data was then analyzed using pivot tables in Excel. Key metrics and dimensions considered included:

- **Geographical Distribution:** Analysis of restaurants by location to identify areas with high and low restaurant densities.
- **Cuisine Popularity:** Examining the popularity of different cuisines to understand consumer preferences.
- **Price Range Analysis:** Evaluating the average price range of restaurants to determine market segments.
- **Rating and Reviews:** Analyzing customer ratings and reviews to assess restaurant performance and customer satisfaction.
## Dashboard
A dynamic dashboard was created using Excel to visualize the key findings. The dashboard includes:
